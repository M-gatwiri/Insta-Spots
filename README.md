# 🌍 Spots App 

Welcome to the Spots App project, an assignment from Alt School. 
An HTML + CSS replication of a Figma design.

## 📌 Project Overview

Spots App is a UI inspired by a Figma prototype. 
My goal is to sharpen frontend development skills by building a pixel-perfect design and adding interactivity with JavaScript, with a future goal to convert to React and implement persistent state management.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (planned for next phase)
- Figma (for UI reference)
- React (planned for next phase)   


## 🚀 What's Next

- Convert the app to React to improve component reusability and state management
- Enhance persistent data handling using React state and context/local storage
- Continue improving accessibility, responsiveness, and user experience
